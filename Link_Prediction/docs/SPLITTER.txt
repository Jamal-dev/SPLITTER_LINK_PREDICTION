for each dataset, in accordance with the standard methodology used in the literature [2,25] we use the largest weakly connected component of the original graph.
brief about dataset split:
1. the input graph is split into two edge sets, Etrain and Etest of equal size.
2. the test edges are removed uniformly at random!? with the restriction that they do not disconnect the graph.
3. Etest is then used as positive examples for classification task.
4. a corresponding equal sized set of non-existent random edges are generated to use as negative examples for testing.

also link prediction is based on [2,25].

evaluation is based on ROC-AUC for each method.


non-embedding baselines:
based on the analysis of adjacency matrix of graph
these methods take into input Etrain during inference. => N(u) is the neighbours of u observed in Etrain
for directed graphs N(u) only refers to the outgoing edges. (must be replaced in the formula of three methods!?)

these methods are both applied to the original graph and persona graph.
in persona graph:
JC, CN, and AA of u,v in the persona graph is the maximum JC, CN, AA of a persona node of u and persona node of v.


embedding baselines:
only applied to persona graph!?

how embedding of edge is calculated:
node2vec -> binary classification logistic regression to learn a model over the hadamard product of the embeddings of the two nodes.
splitter -> maximum dot product between any of their constituent personas in the persona graph.

inference using SPLITTER embeddings:
maximum dot product over all pairs of embeddings of u and v to predict the likelihood of the pair being connected. => so this means we have to chose a threshold and then calculate roc-auc!?
